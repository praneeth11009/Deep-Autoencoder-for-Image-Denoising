    TransponseConvLayer scale up factor 2, 16 filters : name 'tconv2'

increased number of filters in each layer and got better rmse values. decreased batchsize to improve it further.
increased number of filters across encoding layers and decreased acrooss decoding layers to improve.

c)
Images of filters of first layer contain mostly edges and curves since it extracts basic features.
Images of filters in deeper layers have finer texture compared to those of initial layers. This is because as we go deep into the net 
more specific features are extracted.


d)
going deep into the network the image becomes unclear and then starting from decoding layers as we go deep the image becomes more legible.
image is clearest at the start and end layers. the reason given part-c explains this observation also.


e)
denoising poisson noise digit images: the DnCNN network doesn't perform well almost no visible denoising 
The DnCNN is trained on gaussian noise while the test images have poisson noise ie noise models are
different whereas our net is trained on poisson noise. So our net out performs DnCNN. 

denoising cameraman.tif: our network doesn't perform well, we can actually see some digit artifacts in the denoised image.
Our net is trained on digit images whereas the test image is an outdoor scene. So DnCNN outperforms our net.

To sum up difference in noise models, and difference in the train images (eg: outdoor vs digit) cause these differences.
